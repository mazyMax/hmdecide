# Iteration 1 Readme

### 1. Team Member Names
Sixuan Wang: sw3513
Yanhao Li: yl4735
Yaning Ling: yl4741

### 2. Instructions to Run the Program
We use Codio as our development tools, first, create a new ruby on rails project, then in the terminal and run:
$ git clone -b master https://github.com/mazyMax/hmdecide.git

#### NOTE: invite @DelphianCalamity, @chini5ko, @wyjw for access the github

Then enter our project by running:

$ cd hmdecide/
And then run:
$ bundle install
$ yarn install --check-files
$ rails db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
Now the installation is done, then run:
$ rails server -b 0.0.0.0
You will encounter an error because the new url generated by Codio should be added into our config/environments/development.rb
You should replace the line like:
config.hosts << "africa-south-3000.codio.io"
with the new url popped up in the Box URL like:
config.hosts << "beast-mile-3000.codio.io"
Then you need to stop the server, restart it, click the BOX URL, And you will see the website's home page saying: "Help me Decide! Vote Anytime, Anywhere"
Now you may see some posts on the home page, you have to sign up for our website before creating a new vote. After logging in, you could create a new vote, navigate to profile and update your account or log out.
To see cucumber test results, run:
$ rake cucumber
To see spec test coverage results, run:
$ rake spec

### 5. Features we've  implemented and not
a. Fully Implemented: 
    User sign up, log in, log out, update user account like username and password, edit user's detailed information like bio and phone. Home page show all the posts.

b. Half Implemented:  
    When we click the image of posts on home page or from profile, we will always jump to /choices/1
    When we create a new vote and jump to create a new choice, you can only upload one image per post. 
    Though when we click a post, it will show all the choices we created.
    When we click Vote! button in choices/1 page, it will throw an error. We have implemented a function to upvote but we have not figured out a way to test it properly, so we temporarily delete the function and will figure a proper way to test it in future iterations.
    The search field on the navbar has no function yet. Buttons in profile page like 'IGTV', 'SAVED', 'TAGGED' will do nothing. And in the edit profile page only Submit! button works.
    We encounter some css and jquery bugs like the method: :put, method: :delete don't work on rails 6 and after searching for google it seems like a long-existing problem in rails 5.2+ version. So we have to change the "link_to" to "button_to" on certain components like "Logout" on the navbar so it may seem not very cool for now, we will try to solve this problem in future iters.

c. Implement in Future Iterations: 
    Upload multiple choices, search posts by tag, testing for upvote and downvote, send the email for reset password, get stats of votes,  improve about me, better UI layout and design.
